Lesson 3 - **Data Cleaning in R**

1.	Letâ€™s say we have a data frame df representing the table below. What would the following code produce?

df %>%
  transmute(year = str_sub(year_occurred,1,4),
            suffix = str_sub(year_occurred,5,6))

-	An error because str_sub() does not work with data frame columns
