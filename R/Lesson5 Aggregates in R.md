Lesson 5 - Aggregates in R

1.	Grouping a data frame with group_by(), piping the result into a call to mutate(), and defining new columns in terms of summary functions allows you to:
-	create a new data frame that contains one row for each group a new column with per-group metrics
-	**add new columns to a data frame that are based on per-group metrics**
-	add new groups to a data frame that are based on per-column metrics
-	create a new data frame that contains one column for each group a new row with per-group metrics
