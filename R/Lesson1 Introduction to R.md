Lesson 1 - **Introduction to R**

1.	Which of the following sentences explains the conditional statement below?

        if (age >= 18 & registered == TRUE) {
          can_vote <- TRUE
        } else {
          can_vote <- FALSE
        }

-   [x]	**If age is greater than or equal to 18 and registered is TRUE, set the value of can_vote to TRUE. Otherwise, set it to FALSE.**
-   [ ]	If age is greater than or equal to 18 and registered is TRUE, set the value of can_vote to FALSE. Otherwise, set it to TRUE.
-   [ ] If age is greater than 18 and registered is TRUE, set the value of can_vote to TRUE. Otherwise, set it to FALSE.
-   [ ] If age is greater than 18 or registered is TRUE, set the value of can_vote to TRUE. Otherwise, set it to FALSE.

2.	Which of the following examples includes a function call with two arguments?

-   [x]	**sum(289,398)**
-   [ ]	numbers <- c(22,33,44,55)
-   [ ]	population <- '7 billion'
-   [ ]	length(data)

3.	Which of the following defined variables has a logical value?

        cool_variable1 = 324.2
        cool_variable2 = "Hola, mucho gusto."
        cool_variable3 = FALSE
cool_variable4 = 0

-   [x]	**cool_variable3**
-   [ ] cool_variable1
-   [ ] cool_variable4
-   [ ] cool_variable2
