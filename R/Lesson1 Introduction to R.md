        } else {
          can_vote <- FALSE
        }

-   [x]	**If age is greater than or equal to 18 and registered is TRUE, set the value of can_vote to TRUE. Otherwise, set it to FALSE.**
-   [ ]	If age is greater than or equal to 18 and registered is TRUE, set the value of can_vote to FALSE. Otherwise, set it to TRUE.
-   [ ] If age is greater than 18 and registered is TRUE, set the value of can_vote to TRUE. Otherwise, set it to FALSE.
-   [ ] If age is greater than 18 or registered is TRUE, set the value of can_vote to TRUE. Otherwise, set it to FALSE.

3.	Which of the following defined variables has a logical value?

        cool_variable4 = 0

-   [x]	**cool_variable3**
-   [ ] cool_variable1
-   [ ] cool_variable4
-   [ ] cool_variable2

4.	What is the outcome of the following code snippet?

-   [ ]	23
-   [x]	**38**
-   [ ]	0
-   [ ]	2

-   [x] **Vectors can store items of different data types.**
-   [ ] You can retrieve the length of a vector by calling the length() function and passing in the vector as an argument.
-   [ ] Vectors are list-like data-structures.

6.	Which of the following is an example of a single line comment?
